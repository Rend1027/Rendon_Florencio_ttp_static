<h1>My name is Florencio Rendon, my favorite hobby is learning about investing and taxes</h1>

<h3>Did You Know?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Investing your money is the only way to produce wealth( I gave this a second thought and I stand behinnd this statement)</li>
  <li>Investing strategically in a retirement account such as an IRA which is a tax deffered account can lower your taxable income lowering the amount you owe to the IRS </li>
  <li>The U.S. uses a progressive tax system, meaning only the portion of income that exceeds a certain threshold is taxed at the next higher rate</li>
  <li>The S&P 500, is stock market index that measures the performance of the top 500 publicly traded companies in the US</li>
  <li>Historically there has never being a 20 year peroid in which the S&P 500 has produced a negative return </li>
  <li>The 401k or any other type of retirement account that is offered to you by your employer, invests your money in the stock market typically through an index or mutual fund</li>
  <li>Typically if you do not allocate your contributions they will go in to a default fund which may be costly due to the oppurtunity cost</li>
  <li>Last but not least the Stock market is not the only investment you can make, there many other investments out there and one of the most important things you can do is to invest in yourself!</li>
